###Blow Up Space Rocks for Fun and Profit###

Movement:
- WASD to move your spaceship
- LeftShift to reduce velocity to 0
- Spacebar to fire

Objective:
Destroy all the space rocks.  Be careful not to run out of time or ammunition.  There will be pickups available for you to collect -- just be careful not to destroy them first!

Install:

```npm install``` 

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
